# spotiserver
A server-side application that is capable of DJing your party through requests and it's own music choices.
## Purpose
This application is built with a hackathon-sized event in mind. Spotiserver solves the issue of receiving a mass number of requests at a large venue.
## Features
- Add tracks to a Spotify playlist
- Take requests from a third-party source via an endpoint
- Chooses music to add to playlist to add variety
- Prevents one attendee from spamming request list
## Development
All development work will live on the develop branch. Spotiserver is currently in the early stages of development and when ready will be merged into master.
